As a user, you will have approximately 3 days to confirm or deny if the services were rendered before the funds are released automatically due to no response from the other user. While it can be frustrating to wait for a response, there are no ways around this process. It's important to be patient and allow the timeout period to run its course. Any attempt to circumvent this process will only cause further delay in resolving the issue at hand. So, wait for a response or wait for a timeout â€“ either way, trust the system and allow it to work as intended.`
